# Hello, recruiter! 👋

Great to have you here. I am Siiri, and here you can find a bit more about me and what I have worked with.

I worked as a research assistant in [TurkuNLP](https://turkunlp.org/) from May 2024 to December 2025. During my time there, I had the pleasure to contribute to two different projects.

## [Finnish Embeddings](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/finnish-embeddings/tree/main)
The most recent one was work on [Finnish embeddings](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/finnish-embeddings/tree/main), where I...
- preprocessed raw-ish data into a new dataset
- embedded and indexed the data 
- run various tests on openly available embedding models
- visualized results
- annotated samples of the data

to name a few things. Not all work is openly accessible due to the restricted nature of the data.

## [OCR Post-Correction](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/ocr-postcorrection-lm/tree/main/evaluation)
The first project I got to contribute to was published as [OCR Error Post-Correction with LLMs in Historical Documents: No Free Lunches](https://aclanthology.org/2025.resourceful-1.8/) (Kanerva et al., 2025). In the [related repository](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/ocr-postcorrection-lm/tree/main/evaluation), some of my work can be accessed. Again, due to data distribution restrictions, not all my contributions are publicly available. My tasks included but were not limited to
- data preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis
- refactoring code
- annotation.

## What's Up Today
I am currently aiming to finish my master's degree in computer science by the end of Spring 2026. I am also planning to start to work on an annotation tool, a full-stack project that complements my university studies. (The link will be available here shortly.)

Oh, and if you found your way here through the link in my CV: [I wrote that document in HTML and CSS](https://github.com/siiririis/cv-template). Here I have just replaced my information with some mock data. (Who knows, maybe one day this CV turns into an interactive webpage?)
